# Placeholder Style for San Diego release

When San Diego was released, some people found the placeholder text style to be undesirable. The style can be modified by adding the style below to the CSS text box in the selected theme file.

```css
::-webkit-input-placeholder { /* Chrome/Opera/Safari */
  color: pink;
}
::-moz-placeholder { /* Firefox 19+ */
  color: pink;
}
```
